## Passive Skill Rules ##

Passive skills are always active. As an action, a player can attempt to use a passive skill then rolls. The player uses the new result instead of their passive skill check total if the new result is higher and the DM tells them whether or not they succeeded.

<i><u>Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check</u>:</i>  `10 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus`

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive skill check total as a <b>score</b>.

### Use passive skill rules for the following ability checks: ###

<i><u>Arcana</u>:</i>    
`If a player's passive Arcana score meets or exceeds an Abberation's or Dragon's CR + 10, the player knows the Monster's Maximum HP and Abilities.`    

`If a player's passive Arcana score meets or exceeds a spell's level + 12, the player can know the name of the spell as that spell is being cast.`

<i><u>History</u>:</i>    
`If a player's passive History score meets or exceeds a Fey's, Giant's or Humanoid's CR + 10, the player knows the Monster's Maximum HP and Abilities.`

<i><u>Insight</u>:</i>    
`If a player's passive Perception score meets or exceeeds the result of a monster's Deception check, then the player knows that the monster is trying not to reveal information.`

<i><u>Nature</u>:</i>    
`If a player's passive Nature score meets or exceeds a Beast's, Monstrosity's, Ooze's, or Plant's CR + 10, the player knows the Monster's Maximum HP and Abilities.`

<i><u>Perception</u>:</i>    
`If a player's passive Perception score meets or exceeds the result of a monster's Stealth check, the player knows which space the monster occupies and the monster is not hidden.`    

`If a player's passive Perception score meets or exceeds the DC of a trap, the player knows the presence and basic mechanism of a trap.`

<i><u>Religion</u>:</i>    
`If a player's passive Religion score meets or exceeds a Celestial's, Elemental's, Fiend's or Undead's CR + 10, the player knows the Monster's Maximum HP and Abilities.`

<i><u>Acrobatics</u></i>

<i><u>Survival</u>:</i>    
`If the result of a player's Survival skill check exceeds a monster's CR + 10, the player knows the size, number and direction of the monster. If the monster is huge, the player receives a +5 bonus to the result of their skill check. If the monster is tiny, the player receives a -5 penalty to the result of their skill check.`  

<i><u>Sleight of Hand</u>:</i>    
`If the result of a player's Sleight of Hand skill check exceeds a monster's passive perception, the player is able to move or set an object without the monster knowing.`       

`If the result of a player's Sleight of Hand skill check exceeds the DC of a trap, the player is able to move or set an object an object within their reach without activating a trap.`

## Single-Blind Active Skill Rules ##

Players decide when to use single-blind active skills. As an action, a player can attempt to use a single-blind active skill, then rolls. The player sees the result but the DM does not tell them whether or not they succeeded.

### Use single-blind active skill rules for the following ability checks: ###

<i><u>Animal Handling</u>:</i>    
`If the result of a player's Animal Handling skill check exceeds a Beast monster's CR + 10, the monster does not treat the player as hostile. The effect ends if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.`

`If a player's Performance skill modifier + 10 meets or exceeds the rarity modifier of a magic item, the player may activate or attune the magic item without meeting all of the magic item's requirements. The rarity modifier of a magic item increases by +1 for each requirement to activate or attune the magic item.` 

<i><u>Persuasion</u>:</i>    
`If the result of a player's Persuasion skill check exceeds a monster's CHA modifier + 12, the monster finds the player's persuasion agreeable.`    

`If a player's Persuation skill modifier + 10 meets or exceeds a monster's CHA modifier + 12 and the monster is the same type as the player, the monster does not treat the player as hostile.

# Spells #

## Ability Defenses ##

Instead of the DM making saving throws for monsters, players make spell attack rolls against monsters' ability defenses.

<i><u>Here's how to determine a monster's ability defenses</u>:</i>  `14 + Saving Throw` or `14 + Ability Modifier`

If the player's spell attack roll meets or exceeeds the monster's ability defense score, then apply the spell effects as if the monster failed the saving throw.

## Mob Defenses ##

When a large number of monsters are affected by a spell, forgo saving throws in favor of approximating the average number monsters that would make of successful saves. 

Instead of rolling a saving throw, determine the minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to successfully save against a spell by subtracing its saving throw or ability modifier from the spell DC. Look up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob Defense table. The table shows you how many creatures that need that die roll or higher must make a saving throw in order for one of them to successfully save. If that many creatures make a saving throw, then one of them will save on average.

| Mob Defense     |                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| d20 Roll Needed | Saving Throws Needed for One to Succeed |
| 1-5             | 1                                       |
| 6-12            | 2                                       |
| 13-14           | 3                                       |
| 15-16           | 4                                       |
| 17-18           | 5                                       |
